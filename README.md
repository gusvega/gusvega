# Gus Vega — Senior DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Automation Engineer

Seattle, Washington • Senior DevOps engineer focused on cloud infrastructure automation using Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions. I design repeatable patterns for multi environment infrastructure and CI/CD so teams can deploy with confidence instead of clicking through portals.

---

## Summary

I build automation for teams that want:

- Terraform based infrastructure that is easy to reason about, tested, and versioned.
- GitHub Actions pipelines that handle plan, apply, approvals, and rollback for every environment.
- Kubernetes and cloud native workloads that are secure, observable, and boring in production.

My experience is mostly in regulated, multi team environments where auditability, disaster recovery, and access control matter as much as deployment speed.

---

## Core Focus

**Cloud and platforms**

- Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, GKE, Composer, Cloud Storage, IAM).
- Azure (AKS, Data Factory, Key Vault) when it makes sense.

**Infrastructure as code**

- Terraform modules, remote state, multi environment layouts.
- Environment separation for dev, test, staging, and production with promotion workflows.
- Reusable patterns for networks, service accounts, secrets, and policies.

**CI/CD and delivery**

- GitHub Actions pipelines for plan, apply, validation, and deployment across environments.
- Policy, approvals, and compliance built into the pipeline instead of after the fact reviews.
- Rollback strategies based on tags and versioned state.

**Security, reliability, and operations**

- RBAC and least privilege for cloud and Kubernetes.
- Secrets management using cloud native services.
- Monitoring and alerting for infrastructure and applications.

---

## Highlights

- Led CI/CD and infrastructure automation work for multiple product teams, reducing manual deployment steps and making releases predictable across environments.
- Designed Terraform based infrastructure patterns with remote state, versioned tagging, and GitHub Actions workflows that handle plan, apply, and rollback.
- Built Kubernetes and cloud native workloads on Google Cloud with clear separation between environments, clean service boundaries, and secure access patterns.
- Partnered with architects and security engineers to define access patterns and guardrails so product teams can self service infrastructure without opening security holes.
- Mentored engineers and partner teams on Terraform, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, and general DevOps practices through pairing sessions, code review, and design help.

## Featured GitHub Actions for Terraform on Google Cloud

Production ready actions available on the GitHub Marketplace under the **gusvega-dev** namespace:

- **Terraform Plan GCP Action**  
  Containerized action that runs `terraform plan` with structured logs, secret handling through JSON input, and native support for Google Cloud runners.

- **Terraform Apply GCP Action**  
  Containerized action for `terraform apply` that works with the same inputs and secret model, so teams can share one pattern across all environments.

- **Terraform Plan and Apply GCP Action**  
  Combined action for pipelines that need both plan and apply behavior in a single step with clear output.

These actions are built for teams that do not want to install Terraform on runners and prefer a single, opinionated pattern across repositories.

---

## What I am looking for

Senior roles around:

- DevOps and platform engineering.
- Cloud infrastructure automation on Google Cloud with Terraform and Kubernetes.
- CI/CD architecture using GitHub Actions for multi environment deployment, governance, and rollback.

If your team wants to standardize on Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Google Cloud and you need someone to own that story end to end, this is the kind of work I focus on.

---

## How I help teams

- Standardize CI/CD and infrastructure as code patterns so deployments become boring and repeatable.
- Own GitHub Actions automation and Terraform based deployments across dev, test, staging, and production with real audit trails.
- Build and support Kubernetes and cloud native workloads with sane defaults for security, observability, and operations.
